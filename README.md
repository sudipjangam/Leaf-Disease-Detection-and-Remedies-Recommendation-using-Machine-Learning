Plant diseases for a long time are one of the major threats to food security because it dramatically reduces the crop yield and compromises its quality. Plant disease, especially on leaves, is one of the major reagents of reduction in both quality and quantity of the food crops, Thus it leads to an increase in difficulty, food insecurity, and fatality rate. The techniques of digital image processing have been organized in the agriculture field in order to analyze the purposes in different agricultural applications like plant recognition, crop yield estimation, soil quality estimation, etc. The feature extraction method of neural network CNN consists of convolutional layers which are sets of image filters convoluted to images or feature maps along with other layers (pooling). In image classification, feature maps are extracted through convolution and other processing layers repetitively and the network eventually outputs a label indicating an estimated class. Given a training dataset CNN unlike traditional machine learning techniques that use hand-crafted features optimizes the weights and filter parameters in the hidden layers to generate features suitable to solve the classification problem. In principle, the parameters in the network are optimized by backpropagation and gradient descent approaches to minimize the classification error.
